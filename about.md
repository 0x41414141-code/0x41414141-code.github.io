title: About Me
---

I am a student at the Faculty of Electronic Engineering in Niš with a strong passion for cybersecurity and CTF competitions. I enjoy solving challenging problems, analyzing malware, and developing personal projects that help me expand my technical skills.

My main interests include forensics, reverse engineering, malware analysis, and cryptography. I regularly participate in live CTF competitions and am a member of [Team Serbia](https://ctftime.org/team/130070) where I collaborate with other skilled players on a wide range of challenges.

I am proficient in Python, Bash, and Linux, and experienced with a variety of cybersecurity and forensic tools used in reverse engineering, malware analysis, and cryptographic research.
